        <h4>WEB DEVELOPMENT AS AN INDUSTRY</h4>
        <p>
          Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce led
          by Web development include e-commerce. Online auction sites such as
          eBay have changed the way consumers find and purchase goods and
          services. Online retailers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com (among many
          others) have transformed the shopping and bargain-hunting experience
          for many consumers.

        <h3>PRACTICAL WEB DEVELOPMENT</h3>
        <p>
          Since the commercialization of the Web, Web development has been a
          growing industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by
          businesses wishing to use their Web site to advertise and sell
          products and services to customers.[3] There are many open source
          tools for Web development such as BerkeleyDB, GlassFish, LAMP (Linux,
          Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and Perl/Plack. This has kept the cost of
          learning Web development to a minimum. Another contributing factor to
          the growth of the industry has been the rise of easy-to-use WYSIWYG
          Web-development software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and
          Microsoft Visual Studio. Knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
          or of programming languages is still required to use such software,
          but the basics can be learned and implemented quickly. An ever-growing
          set of tools and technologies have helped developers build more
          dynamic and interactive Web sites. Further, Web developers now help to
          deliver applications as Web services which were traditionally only
          available as applications on a desk-based computer. This has allowed
          for many opportunities to decentralize information and media
          distribution. Examples can be seen with the rise of cloud services
          such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and Google Drive. These Web
          services allow users to interact with applications from many
          locations, instead of being tied to a specific workstation for their
          application environment.
